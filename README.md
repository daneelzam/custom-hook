# Custom Hooks in React: Best Practices, Use Case, and Test Coverage
---
In this repository, using the example of writing a custom hook for useOpenLibrary, which is designed to work with the Open Library API, the best practices for writing custom hooks are used:
- Use the use prefix in the hook name
- Avoid working directly with the DOM
- Don't use hooks inside conditional statements
- Return an array or object from a custom hook
- Document your code
- Test your code
